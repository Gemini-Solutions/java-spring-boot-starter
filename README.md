## Description
This repository serves as a template for creating Java projects. It provides a standardized folder structure, pre-configured settings, and essential dependencies to help developers quickly set up and start building Java applications. By using this template, developers can save time and effort in the initial project setup and focus on implementing the core functionality of their application. The template includes a recommended folder structure, build system configuration, sample code, and testing setup, providing a solid foundation for Java development.

## Storing credentials in Secrets
A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key.Using a Secret means that you don't need to include confidential data in your application code.
One of the key advantages of employing secrets is the ability to separate sensitive information from the codebase itself. This practice enhances security by minimizing the risk of inadvertent leaks or unauthorized access to confidential data.

[This](https://wiki.geminisolutions.com/en/GemProduct/TokenMintingService/token) wiki walks you through the process and equipping you with the knowledge to securely manage and utilize secrets in your projects.
